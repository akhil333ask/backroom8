# Handoff: one continuous world (zones instead of levels)

Status legend: [x] done, [ ] todo. Update this file as you go.

## Plan (6 lines)
1. World floors = index 0..3 = B1, 1, 2, 3 at world y = index * FLOOR_H (FLOORS = 4). Yellow floors are the old
   generateFloor(seed, 0..2) re-indexed to 1..3, so their look is unchanged; B1 is the garage zone.
2. Garage generator is unchanged internally; `lib/world/garage-zone.ts` places it with origin (ox,oy,oz) =
   (-14, -1.3, -32.4) so its upper deck is y=0 (B1) and it sits under the building; colliders/spots/lights are offset.
3. B1 lobby (stairwell bottom door -> corridor -> elevator front -> doorway into the garage) and the vehicle ramp
   (F1 east wall door at z=46.5 -> outside corridor x 54..60 -> garage east wall at aisle z=12.6) are part of the garage zone.
4. `lib/world/zones.ts` = zone defs (env, sound, name) + portals; `lib/world/zone-manager.ts` = current zone, mounted
   set (current + neighbours near a portal, staggered one per few frames, 2+ away unmounted/disposed), env blending.
5. Player/interact/env/light rig read the world instead of LevelConfig. Stairwell + elevator get 4 floors (B1,1,2,3).
6. Level dropdown only with ?debug=1 (teleport to zone start); no per-level loading; Pool/Living plug in as zones later.

## World coordinates (meters)
- Yellow building: x 0..54, z 0..54, floors at y 3.4 / 6.8 / 10.2 (index 1..3). Stairwell x -6..0, z 24..32.
- Elevator shaft x 24..30, z 30..33 (front at z 29.9). Lobby on yellow floors is the old LOBBY.
- Garage (B1): local (0..68, 0..54) -> world x -14..54, z -32.4..21.6; lower deck y -1.3, upper deck y 0.
- B1 lobby: x 0..32, z 22..30, y 0..3, door into garage at x 26..28 (garage south wall z 21.6..22).
- Ramp: x 54.2..60.2; top landing z 45..48.5 (y 3.4), slope z 45 -> 24, bottom pad z 10.2..24 (y 0),
  garage east-wall door at z 11.6..13.6.

## Checklist
- [x] constants: FLOORS=4, YELLOW_FLOORS=3, FLOOR_NAMES
- [x] world-generator: opts { zone override (F3 = zone 1 tan/dark), extra east door (F1 ramp) }
- [x] garage-layout: opts { keepClear rects, wall openings } (look unchanged)
- [x] lib/world/garage-zone.ts (offset garage + lobby + ramp geometry data, colliders, ground)
- [x] lib/world/zones.ts + zone-manager.ts
- [x] store.ts: loadWorld(seed), teleportToZone(id)
- [x] player.tsx ground/collision from world
- [x] elevator (4 buttons, B1 facade concrete), interact labels, textures digits B1
- [x] components/world/garage-zone-scene.tsx, world-scene (mount/visibility), env blending, zone card
- [x] hud: dropdown only with ?debug=1, zone name card
- [x] Living Room brighter (2x ambient/lamps, larger fog far) — in its LevelConfig values
- [x] tsc passes
- [x] browser check: B1 lobby -> garage doorway, B1 elevator facade, stairwell bottom (B1) with fire door,
      ramp heights (bottom 0 / mid 1.7 / top 3.4) and ramp -> Floor 1 doorway, Floor 3 Zone B, debug teleport.
- [ ] Not measured yet: total draw calls with all visible zones (target ~100). Check with renderer.info in ?debug=1.

## How it works now (read before editing)
- `lib/backrooms/store.ts` `loadWorld(seed)` builds all CPU data (4 floors, hide spots, garage zone). No level switching.
- `lib/world/zone-manager.ts` `updateZones()` is called from Player every frame: current zone -> `ui.zone`
  (drives ZoneCard), env blend -> `zoneEnv` (read by LevelEnvironment + GarageLights), mounted set -> `ui.mounted`.
- `components/world/world-scene.tsx` mounts geometry per `ui.mounted`; unmount disposes (garage also disposes
  its textures/materials via `disposeGarage`). Light rigs stay mounted so the shader light count never changes.
- Player ground = stairs ?? ramp ?? garage decks (B1) ?? floor * FLOOR_H. Collision = stairwell + floors k-1..k+1.
- Debug: `?debug=1` shows the zone teleport dropdown and exposes `window.__game`; `&zone=garage` spawns there.
  Headless browsers run at a low FPS (dt is capped), so test by placing `__game.player` rather than walking.
- Old `levels/*` LevelConfigs + `levels/registry.ts` are no longer used by the game; their layouts/scenes are
  reused as zones (garage done). Level 3 values were brightened (2x ambient/lamps, fog far 17 -> 30).

## DONE: Pool + Living Room wings (session 2)
Files: `lib/world/wings.ts` (origins, corridors/hallways, colliders, spots, lights), `components/world/wing-scenes.tsx`
(WingScene = unchanged PoolScene/LivingScene in a `<group position={origin}>` + connectors; WingLights = 6 always-mounted
point lights with per-fixture colour), `components/world/render-stats.tsx` (debug draw-call probe).
Generator opts (look unchanged): `generateFloor` westDoors/northDoors, `generatePools` eastOpenings,
`generateLiving` southOpenings/hallSouthOpenings. Scenes take `lights={false}` when used as a zone.

World coordinates (m):
- Pool wing, Floor 2: POOL_ORIGIN (-66, 6.8, 4) -> pool x -66..-18, z 4..40. Yellow F2 west-wall doors at cell rows
  3 (z 10.5, glowing tiled ARCHWAY corridor) and 12 (z 37.5, plain door corridor); wet tiled corridors x -18..0, 2.4 wide.
- Living wing, Floor 1: LIVING_ORIGIN (1.5, 3.4, -50) -> cluster x 1.5..19.5, z -50..-38, internal hall z ~-47,
  loop room x 49.5..55.5 (two wrong doors loop back into it). Yellow F1 north-wall doors at cell cols 3 (x 10.5 ->
  38m hallway A, one flickering sconce, enters cluster south wall) and 11 (x 34.5 -> 46m hallway B, enters the
  internal hallway's south wall). Loop for hiders: yellow -> A -> rooms -> long hall -> B -> yellow.
- `floorOf(feet, x?, z?)` returns 2 inside the pool wing (deep water sinks feet below Floor 2's threshold).
- Wing colliders are appended to `game.floors[1|2].colliders` AFTER yellow hide-spot placement (yellow unchanged).
- Blackouts: WingLights applies `zoneFactor` per fixture and drives `updateBlackouts` when the yellow floor isn't mounted.
- Living env (lib/world/zones.ts LIVING_ENV) is brighter than level-3 (hemi 1.7, amb 0.55, lamps x1.4) - readable w/o flashlight.
- Portals have an optional `range`: elevator 3.5m, stair doors 9m (others 15m). Mounted neighbours are unmounted
  (disposed) past range*1.6+2, so only current + nearby connected zones exist; 2+ steps away is never mounted.

Measured draw calls (seed 1234, `?debug=1`, `window.__stats`, whole frame incl. postprocessing):
- Before: F1 lobby 101; F1 elevator lobby with F1+F2+garage mounted 130-132.
- After: F1 elevator lobby 88-101; pool interior 52; F2 at pool archway (yellow-2 + pool) 75;
  F1 at living doors (yellow-1 + living) 78-94; living interior 52.

## DONE: Third-person camera + Free Fire style controls + roles (session 3)
Plan: no TP camera existed, so one was added. Files (new): `lib/characters/roles.ts`, `lib/backrooms/controls-config.ts`,
`lib/backrooms/third-person-camera.ts`, `components/characters/character-body.tsx`. Edited: player.tsx (camera block,
movement, role speeds, run/attack), store.ts (player.bodyYaw/attackT, input.runHeld/attackQueued, game.role),
player-store.ts (toggleCrouch respects role), touch-controls.tsx (rewritten to spec), input-controller.tsx (click =
attack, P = debug first-person), flashlight.tsx (beam from chest, aimed along camera), level-environment.tsx (FOV 65).
- [x] roles.ts (`?role=seeker`, default hider; `currentRole()` in store.ts) + controls-config.ts (all tunables)
- [x] third-person camera: pivot = feet + 1.7 (lowered when crouching), back 3.2 / right 0.5, slab raycast vs the same
      BoxSources Player uses for movement (stairs, floors k-1..k+1, elevator door), ceiling plane from `ceilingAt()`
      (garage 2.6, cab ELEV.cabCeil, office CEIL_H). Pull-in is instant, regain at 6 m/s. `game.camDist` -> body fade.
- [x] placeholder body + blob shadow (components/characters/character-body.tsx, ~5 draw calls, no shadows)
- [x] player.tsx wiring. p.yaw/p.pitch = CAMERA view (look-up positive, so clamp is [-50deg, +25deg]); p.bodyYaw =
      facing. Hiding still uses updateHidden (first-person peek) and the body is hidden. Seeker: crouch forced off,
      hide spots filtered out in interact.ts, `roleCaps.canCrouch` blocks toggleCrouch.
- [x] touch controls rewritten (pointerId tracking, buttons capture their own pointer + stopPropagation)
- [x] desktop: left click = attack (also starts drag / pointer lock), P = first-person (only with ?debug=1)
- [x] tsc passes
- [x] browser check (desktop): yellow F1 spawn, garage as seeker, wall pull-in 3.2 -> 1.12m at garage west wall,
      garage ceiling clamp (lower deck, pitch -0.5 -> 1.28m), chest flashlight, debug first-person toggle, no errors.
- [ ] Not verified: real touch device (headless reports pointer:fine, so TouchControls didn't mount). Test multi-touch
      on a phone: joystick + look drag + RUN held at the same time. Hide-spot enter/exit not re-tested in browser.
- [ ] Draw calls with the body not re-measured (body adds ~5).
- [x] Attack hit detection: see Seeker section (no damage/health/scoring by design).

## Seeker: Smiler FBX model + animation (session 4, DONE)
Credits (shown in UI when role=seeker): "Smiler (Backrooms) by lucaarcadu, CC BY".
Files in public/models/seeker (exact, case matters - note capital `Idle.fbx`): Idle, attack, down-stairs,
run-upstairs, run, swim-to-edge, swim, walk -> all 8 states matched, none missing. All share mesh `Cube001_Cube001`,
65 bones (`mixamorigHips`...), track names already colon-free. Source material 0 = body (biggest group),
material 1 = eyes/mouth. 8 draw groups merged to 2 at load -> seeker costs 2 draw calls (+1 ripples, +1 blob).
Posed height ~940 cm, feet at y0, faces +Z (rotated PI).
- `lib/characters/anim-map.ts`: THE config (state -> file, loop/once, eager, refSpeed, playSeconds, thresholds,
  attack cone, SWIM_LIFT/WADE_SINK, credits). Wade reuses walk.fbx as its own clip.
- `lib/characters/seeker-model.ts`: FBXLoader; mesh/skeleton from walk.fbx, only animations[0] from others.
  Eager: idle/walk/run (+wade); the rest lazy after the model shows. Scale from posed bbox to 2.6m. Strips hips
  X/Z (after measuring it -> nativeSpeed used for foot-sync timeScale). Sanitizes `mixamorig:`/`Armature|` names,
  logs unmatched tracks. MeshStandardMaterial #B8A838 roughness 0.6, eyes/mouth black.
- `lib/characters/seeker-animator.ts`: picks state (attack > swim-to-edge > swim > idle > wade > stairs > run/walk),
  0.2s crossfades, timeScale = speed / clip native speed (clamped). Fallbacks: idle -> frozen walk frame 0;
  stairs/wade -> walk; attack missing -> procedural arm lunge after mixer.update(). swim-to-edge plays once when
  leaving deep water. Stairs clips when |p.slope| > 0.12 (p.slope tracked in player.tsx, smoothed rise/run).
- `lib/characters/seeker-store.ts`: reactive role (runtime switch), debug info, `attackTargets` registry,
  `emitAttack` -> `game.lastAttack` + `attackListeners` (= the `player.attack` event).
- `components/characters/seeker-character.tsx` (R3F, mounted by CharacterBody when `role.model`): placeholder
  stays until the mesh + eager clips load. Wade: model -0.1m + additive instanced ripple rings. Deep: +1.15m lift.
- `components/characters/seeker-overlay.tsx`: credits; with ?debug=1 the panel (clips, state, force buttons,
  speed slider). `debug-dummies.tsx`: K leaves a hider dummy where you stood (flashes red when hit).
- player.tsx: ATTACK_TIME now 1.0s, 1s cooldown, hit check at 40% into the attack (cone 1.8m / 90deg, +-1.5m
  height). Shallow water speed 0.6. Seeker camera pivot +0.45m (`RoleConfig.cameraLift`).
- Verified in browser: model yellow, idle/walk/stairs-up/swim/attack play, all 9 clips load, cone hit + miss.
- Draw calls: ~70-80 with one zone mounted, ~122 when 3 zones are mounted at a boundary (seeker adds 4).
- [ ] Not verified in browser: stair slope auto-switch, wade ripples and swim-to-edge in the real pool (headless
      preview runs at ~1-3 fps). SWIM_LIFT may need tuning by eye.

## Next ideas (not done)
- Further draw-call savings: merge FloorMesh's plain-colour prop materials into one vertex-coloured material.
- Wing emissive fixtures (panels, lamp shades) don't dim during blackouts; only their point lights do.
